**Password Generator**

The objective of the project is to create a Python script that generates strong, secure passwords. The script allows users to specify the length and number of passwords they want to generate.It generates unique combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

**Features:**

**1.Robust Security:** The generated passwords are designed to meet modern security standards, ensuring that they are strong and resistant to various forms of attacks, including brute-force and dictionary attacks.

**2.Customizability:** Users have the flexibility to specify the length of each password as well as the number of passwords they want to generate. This allows them to tailor the generated passwords to the specific requirements of their applications or security policies.

**3.Efficiency:** The script efficiently generates passwords using built-in Python functions and libraries, making the process quick and seamless. Users can generate multiple passwords in a matter of seconds, streamlining their workflow.

**4.User-Friendly Interface:** The script provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to interact with. Clear prompts guide users through the process of generating passwords, ensuring a smooth user experience.
